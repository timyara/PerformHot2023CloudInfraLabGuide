## Kubernetes Platform Health 

### Learning Concepts

- By default, we are deploying out Kubernetes Operator in the "ClassicFullStack" mode. 

- It's comprehensive. This all-in-one approach includes Kubernetes cluster monitoring, distributed tracing, fault domain isolation, and deep code-level insights using a single deployment configuration across your clusters

- Detects new containers and injects OneAgent code modules into application pods using classic full-stack injection

- Kubernetes ActiveGate collects cluster and workload metrics, events, and status from the Kubernetes API.


- Cluster, node, pod, workloads, namespaces, containers, etc... Can be checked with a few quick clicks to the resource level you want to analyze deeper. 

- Collects host metrics from Kubernetes nodes (CPU/Memory)

- Kubernetes Dashboards provide your teams with a "Holistic view" or the "single pane of glass". Whether that is a place to start troubleshooting, or understanding what is deployed in the eco-system. **
